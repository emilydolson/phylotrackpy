# Roadmap

## Objectives

The Phylotrack project seeks to
  1. strengthen digital evolution work by making it fast and simple to record agent lineages and
  2. facilitate scalable analyses of biological phylogeny data by providing an efficient C++-native tree representation.

## v1.0.0

- strengthen interoperability with bioinformatics conventions and formats
- fixup and document data node interface
- implement unifurcation collapse
- finalize and document deepcopy behavior

## Long-term goals

- implement or inter-operate with comprehensive suite of phylostatistic functions
- add features and documentation to target use cases with traditional reconstructed phylogenies
- integrate with evolutionary simulation frameworks (i.e., MABE, DEAP, etc.)
- support sexual phylogenies
