# Projects Using the Software


# Related Software


* Automated Phylogeny Over Geological Timescales (APOGeT) [@godin2019apoget],
* Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (DEAP) [@de2012deap],
* Empirical [@ofria2020empirical], and
* Modular Agent-Based Evolution Framework (MABE) [@bohm2017mabe].

Empirical, MABE, and APOGeT are C++ libraries.
DEAP, eponymously, is a Python library.

<!-- Empirical and MABE's phylogenetic tracking tools cater to asexual lineages, while DEAP and APOGeT focus on sexual lineages.
Both MABE and Empirical incorporate options for on-the-fly pruning, where records for extinct lineages are deleted in order to temper memory use.
APOGeT focuses on species-level tracking rather than individual-level genealogical tracking. -->
