Mutualisms are vital to humankind: Pollinators and soil microbes are critical in agriculture, bacterial microbiomes regulate our health, and domesticated animals provide us with food and companionship. Many hypotheses exist on how mutualisms evolve; however, they are difficult to evaluate without bias, due to the fragile and idiosyncratic systems most often investigated. Instead, we have created an artificial life simulation, Symbulation, which we use to examine mutualism evolution based on (1) the probability of vertical transmission (symbiont being passed to offspring) and (2) the spatial structure of the environment. We found that spatial structure can lead to less mutualism at intermediate vertical transmission rates. We provide evidence that this effect is due to the ability of quasi species to purge parasites, reducing the diversity of available symbionts. Our simulation is easily extended to test many additional hypotheses about the evolution of mutualism and serves as a general model to quantitatively compare how different environments affect the evolution of mutualism.},

From the mitochondrion residing in almost every eukaryotic cell to the gut microbiome found in every human, endosymbiosis is a cornerstone of the biological processes that sustain life on Earth. While endosym-biosis is ubiquitous, many questions about its origins remain shrouded in mystery; one question in particular regards the general conditions and possible trajectories for its evolution. Modern science has hypothesized two possible pathways for the evolution of mutualistic endosymbiosis: one where an obligate antagonism is co-opted into an obligate mutualism (Co-Opted Antagonism Hypothesis), and one where a facultative mutualism evolves into an obligate mutualism (Black Queen Hypothesis). We investigated the viability of these pathways under different environmental conditions by expanding on the evolutionary agent-based system Symbulation. Specifically, we considered the impact of ectosymbiosis on de novo evolution of obligate mutualistic endosymbiosis. We found that introducing a facultative ectosymbiotic state allows endosym-biosis to evolve in a more diverse set of environmental conditions, while also decreasing the evolution of endosymbiosis in conditions where it can evolve independently.},

	abstract = {Building more open-ended evolutionary systems can simultaneously advance our understanding of biology, artificial life, and evolutionary computation. In order to do so, however, we need a way to determine when we are moving closer to this goal. We propose a set of metrics that allow us to measure a system's ability to produce commonly-agreed-upon hallmarks of open-ended evolution: change potential, novelty potential, complexity potential, and ecological potential. Our goal is to make these metrics easy to incorporate into a system, and comparable across systems so that we can make coherent progress as a field. To this end, we provide detailed algorithms (including C++ implementations) for these metrics that should be easy to incorporate into existing artificial life systems. Furthermore, we expect this toolbox to continue to grow as researchers implement these metrics in new languages and as the community reaches consensus about additional hallmarks of open-ended evolution. For example, we would welcome a measurement of a system's potential to produce major transitions in individuality. To confirm that our metrics accurately measure the hallmarks we are interested in, we test them on two very different experimental systems: {NK} landscapes and the Avida digital evolution platform. We find that our observed results are consistent with our prior knowledge about these systems, suggesting that our proposed metrics are effective and should generalize to other systems.},

	abstract = {The use of phylogenies in ecology is increasingly common and has broadened our understanding of biological diversity. Ecological sub-disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub-disciplines hampers potential meta-analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriate metric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo-diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information. Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between assemblages tend to ask three types of question: how much; how different; or how regular? We show that these questions reflect three dimensions of a phylogenetic tree: richness, divergence, and regularity. We classify 70 existing phylo-diversity metrics based on their mathematical form within these three dimensions and identify ‘anchor’ representatives: for α-diversity metrics these are {PD} (Faith's phylogenetic diversity), {MPD} (mean pairwise distance), and {VPD} (variation of pairwise distances). By analysing mathematical formulae and using simulations, we use this framework to identify metrics that mix dimensions, and we provide a guide to choosing and using the most appropriate metrics. We show that metric choice requires connecting the research question with the correct dimension of the framework and that there are logical approaches to selecting and interpreting metrics. The guide outlined herein will help researchers navigate the current jungle of indices.},

These platforms have been used to great effect as a controlled system in which to conduct evolutionary experiments and develop novel evolutionary theory. In addition to their complex evolutionary dynamics, many digital evolution systems also produce rich ecological communities. As a result, digital evolution is also a powerful tool for research on eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here, we review the research to date in which digital evolution platforms have been used to address eco-evolutionary (and in some cases purely ecological) questions. This work has spanned a wide range of topics, including competition, facilitation, parasitism, predation, and macroecological scaling laws. We argue for the value of further ecological research in digital evolution systems and present some particularly promising directions for further research.},

A system of priorities that reflects the value of taxonomic diversity can be achieved by setting priorities such that the subset of taxa that is protected has maximum underlying feature diversity. Such feature diversity of taxon subsets is difficult to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the cladistic/phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. In this study, a simple measure of phylogenetic diversity is defined based on cladistic information. The measure of phylogenetic diversity, {PD}, is contrasted with a measure of taxic diversity recently developed by Vane-Wright et al. (Biol. Conserv., 55, 1991). In re-examining reserve-selection scenarios based on a phylogeny of bumble bees (Apidae), {PD} produces quite different priorities for species conservation, relative to taxic diversity. The potential application of {PD} at levels below that of the species is then illustrated using a {mtDNA} phylogeny for populations of crested newts Triturus cristatus. Calculation of {PD} for different population subsets shows that protection of populations at either of two extremes of the geographic range of the group can significantly increase the phylogenetic diversity that is protected.},

	abstract = {The Colless index is one of the most popular and natural balance indices for bifurcating phylogenetic trees, but it makes no sense for multifurcating trees. In this paper we propose a family of Colless-like balance indices C D , f that generalize the Colless index to multifurcating phylogenetic trees. Each C D , f is determined by the choice of a dissimilarity D and a weight function f : N → R ≥ 0. A balance index is sound when the most balanced phylogenetic trees according to it are exactly the fully symmetric ones. Unfortunately, not every Colless-like balance index is sound in this sense. We prove then that taking f(n) = ln(n + e) or f(n) = en as weight functions, the resulting index C D , f is sound for every dissimilarity D. Next, for each one of these two functions f and for three popular dissimilarities D (the variance, the standard deviation, and the mean deviation from the median), we find the most unbalanced phylogenetic trees according to C D , f with any given number n of leaves. The results show that the growth pace of the function f influences the notion of “balance” measured by the indices it defines. Finally, we introduce our R package “{CollessLike},” which, among other functionalities, allows the computation of Colless-like indices of trees and their comparison to their distribution under Chen-Ford-Winkel’s α-γ-model for multifurcating phylogenetic trees. As an application, we show that the trees in {TreeBASE} do not seem to follow either the uniform model for multifurcating trees or the α-γ-model, for any values of α and γ.},

	abstract = {Conservation priority setting based on phylogenetic diversity has frequently been proposed but rarely implemented. Here, we define a simple index that measures the contribution made by different species to phylogenetic diversity and show how the index might contribute towards species-based conservation priorities. We describe procedures to control for missing species, incomplete phylogenetic resolution and uncertainty in node ages that make it possible to apply the method in poorly known clades. We also show that the index is independent of clade size in phylogenies of more than 100 species, indicating that scores from unrelated taxonomic groups are likely to be comparable. Similar scores are returned under two different species concepts, suggesting that the index is robust to taxonomic changes. The approach is applied to a near-complete species-level phylogeny of the Mammalia to generate a global priority list incorporating both phylogenetic diversity and extinction risk. The 100 highest-ranking species represent a high proportion of total mammalian diversity and include many species not usually recognised as conservation priorities. Many species that are both evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered ({EDGE} species) do not benefit from existing conservation projects or protected areas. The results suggest that global conservation priorities may have to be reassessed in order to prevent a disproportionately large amount of mammalian evolutionary history becoming extinct in the near future.},

	abstract = {In multivariate analyses of the effects of both natural and anthropogenic environmental variability on community composition, many species are interchangeable in the way that they characterise the samples, giving rise to the concept of structural redundancy in community composition. Here, we develop a method of quantifying the extent of this redundancy by extracting a series of subsets of species, the multivariate response pattern of each of which closely matches that for the whole community. Structural redundancy is then reflected in the number of such subsets, which we term “response units”, that can be extracted without replacement. We have applied this technique to the effects of the Amoco-Cadiz oil-spill on marine macrobenthos in the Bay of Morlaix, France, and to the natural interannual variability of macrobenthos at two stations off the coast of Northumberland, England. Structural redundancy is shown to be remarkably high, with the number and sizes of subsets being comparable in all three examples. Taxonomic/functional groupings of species within the differing response units change in abundance in the same way over time. The response units are shown to possess a wide taxonomic spread and, using two different types of randomisation test, demonstrated to have a taxonomically and functionally coherent structure. The level of structural redundancy may therefore be an indirect measure of the resilience or compensation potential within an assemblage.},

	shorttitle = {A further biodiversity index applicable to species lists},
	abstract = {A further biodiversity index is proposed, based on taxonomic (or phylogenetic) relatedness of species, namely the 'variation in taxonomic distinctness¹ ({VarTD}, Λ+) between every pair of species recorded in a study. It complements the previously defined 'average taxonomic distinctness' ({AvTD}, Δ+), which is the mean path length through the taxonomic tree connecting every pair of species in the list. {VarTD} is simply the variance of these pairwise path lengths and reflects the unevenness of the taxonomic tree. For example, a species list in which there are several different orders represented only by a single species, but also some genera which are very species-rich,
would give a high Λ+ by comparison with a list (of equivalent Δ+) in which all species tended to be from different families but the same order. {VarTD} is shown to have the same desirable sampling properties as {AvTD}, primarily a lack of dependence of its mean value on the sample size (except for unrealistically small samples). Such unbiasedness is of crucial importance in making valid biodiversity comparisons between studies at different locations or times, with differing or uncontrolled degrees of sampling effort. This feature is emphatically not shared by indices related to species richness and also not by properties of the phylogeny adapted from proposals in other, conservation contexts, such as 'average phylogenetic diversity' ({AvPD}, Φ+). As with {AvTD}, the {VarTD} statistic for any local study can be tested for 'departure from expectation', based on a master taxonomy for that region, by constructing a simulation distribution from random subsets of the master list. The idea can be extended to summarising the joint distribution of {AvTD} and {VarTD}, so that values from real data sets are compared with a fitted simulation 'envelope' in a 2 d (Δ+, Λ+) plot. The methodology is applied to 14 species lists of free-living marine nematodes, and related to a master list for {UK} waters. The combination of {AvTD} and
{VarTD} picks out, in different ways, some degraded locations (low Δ+, low to normal Λ+) and the pristine island fauna of the Scillies (normal Δ+, high Λ+). The 2 indices are also demonstrated to be measuring effectively independent features of the taxonomic tree, at least for this faunal group (although it is shown theoretically that this will not always be the case). The combination of Δ+ and Λ+ is therefore seen to provide a statistically robust summary of taxonomic (or phylogenetic) relatedness patterns within an assemblage, which has the potential to be applied to a wide range of historical data in the form of simple species lists.},
