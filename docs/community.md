## Governance

As an early-stage project, Phylotrack currently operates under a founder-leader model, where project decisions are driven by consensus within a small group of core maintainers.
[Emily Dolsonn](https://github.com/emilydolson) and [Matthew Andres Moreno](https://github.com/mmore500) currently lead in this role.

We are committed to actively involving Phylotrackâ€™s user community in project decision-making.
Please use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/emilydolson/phylotrackpy/issues) to suggest features and highlight important library use cases.
Keep up with announcements and contribute to broader discussion through mailing list, which you can join [here](https://groups.google.com/g/phylotrack).
